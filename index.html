                <p>Hi Guys</p>

                <p>  Good morning/evening/afternoon/ </p>
                 <p>This is Me - Zwe (Luke) Currently in TeamPhoenix A+ class, I started playing freestyle skating in 2018 and When I start playing there are not a lot of people you can go check out the <a href="https://teamphoenixweb.github.io/History-of-TeamPhoenix/">History of Teamphoenix</a> there is a total of players.
                  when I start to play there is a lot of difficulties When I started to play I was 9years old if I didn't forgot but hopefully not. 
                  I thought I would not play this sport for this long but It's become my dream, not gonna lie I enjoy playing this. 
                  But I admit that that's my first main sport and I didn't even know how sports work. 
                  I am so talkative but try my best to focus on the training but later on, I didn't even talk to anyone except my coach during my training times. 
                  I put more effort into my training but there is a lot of difficulties but Our team tried our best and can read in TeamPhoenixHistory, We didn't even have a good skate rink but whatever ever let's go to the next year 2019. 
                  It going as a normal day but our coach told us that we are gonna compete competition which is located on Thailand and that's competition is Asean competition which means all of the countries from ASEAN goanna came. 
                  I didn't have that much pressure but I was trying my best in it and this is my first international competition, By the way before this competition I have competed in local competitions.
                  
                  I get thirds in Thailand ASEAN Competition which we didn't expect to get, I will be honest that I am so scared and happy about this(my first medal from an international competition) I am proud of myself but I know I have to put more effort and train more and after that, I have been to the china I didn't really remember what town is it and Only me and my brother second coach we have been on flight and airport for 1day which make me not to fly again but whatever. 
                  After that, We have arrived at the hotel by midnight and which is so cold. 
                  The next morning we have been to the competition area by running there, and we have been having fun a lot in there by going around, eating random food, taking random pictures, and been to random places, and we have got a competition tomorrow so we go back to the hotel and rest the rest of the day. 
                  Now we are on competition day and like before we are going to the competition area by running again so that we can warm ourselves a little bit before skating, and after the competition, we didn't get anything but we are not gonna give up here we decided to put more effort on that and more training on that when we arrive. 
                  Now we are back in our local Country Myanmar. 
                  Sadly Covid - 19 started in 2019 end of the years in Myanmar so we have to stop our outside training and we do online training so that we can improve more, I expect, I improve more than last time in 2021 and 2022, and after everything is fine we are back on training and try to be so success. 
                  And I have been going through the normal day like before training and competing in local competitions, But at the end of 2022 which is in December we are back in Thailand for competition this time I know I can do better than last time and I got second in there I am happy with that but I know is not even enough for me because my goal is so high. 
                  After the competition, we have been to Thailand for training till January. 
                  
                  When I am been on Thailand this times I knew that Thailand people are so kind and so helpful to others which is so good and glad to see that. 
                  After I back from Thailand I am back in the process which is training and trying to reach my goal I know is gonna take a while and have to go a long and hard way which can even get hurt a lot of people quit skating in front of my eyes they just give up but this is a competition too. 
                  And after a few months later we got an announcement from our ASEAN that we got invited to the ASEAN championship competition, I wanted to go there so bad so we have a competition to choose who to call and I want to get chosen so I join a competition, Win and got chosen to join ASEAN Championship. 
                  And we heading to there at March/8/2023 and this competition is located in Singapore this times and which is one of the best country. 
                  When we got there I was so empress that how Singapore can manage these cool things but whatever. 
                  We visit around by bus, train and even tho with skate I do enjoy it a lot and I will be honest that this is the most fun trip that I have ever had in my life. 
                  And at March/10/2023 competition started and one of our team member compete on that day, me, another member and my coach are goanna compete on March/11/2023, he try his best on the competition, after the competition was done we are back to visit and we have a lot of fun again but we go back to the hotel a little bit early because we have to rest during the competition days. 
                  The next morning we go to the competition area and do a little bit of ground test which is so slip, But our category is the last one so we are just watching other players and enjoying a lot. 
                  And now our terms I was so scared and shaking a lot but I know I need to do this and try my best as much as I can, we got a warm-up for 5min and after 5min competition started, the first match is for the qualification round it was kind of easy and another round was a quarter-final, is still kind of easy but start from the semi-final and final I was getting scared more and more don't know why but I was decided to calm down and try my best on this 2round when semi-final was done they call a name of the player who got an into the final round, they have to call 4player but my coach said 3 and after they announcer was announcing 3player I thought I couldn't get into final but they call me at the last and I was so happy I even hug to my friend from Singapore. 
                  I have put more focus on the competition so I can reduce my scare and can clam down more abit and when they competition was done and waiting for results, we are having fun, dancing with all of the countries that's came to competition. 
                  When is time to get medals I got second and 2Indonasion got first and third I even got world rank 76th which is one of my dreams to get world rank. 
                  After the competition, we got invited to a party and when we arrive at the party is so much fun we made a new friend and I even got my new shoes. 
                  After that  Is time to come back to Myanmar, by telling goodbye to our new friends and Singapore. 
                  I have the plan to do our training more and improve more and get ready for the next coming competition but I just got informed by my parents that I have to move to Europe, Which is one of my dreams to study there and compete in the Europe competition, So I have planned to go to Thailand first and make a visa to stay there and they give me a visa at 20th June and before they give me that I have arrived back to Myanmar and stay there for a bit but now they give me a visa so I have to go back to Thailand at 3rd July take visa and go to Europe at 6th of July but No matter where I am at I am still goanna ride this inline freestyle skating and reach my dream. </p>
